<p align="center">regarding Pony Town—if you would like to tell me something but i am not on the tab/idle, please do feel free to whisper me!! 
<p align="center">usually i go just . wherever i please, and come online at extremely sporadic times, so i will not be reliable to find o7 however, since my hyperfixation at the moment is currently Persona, i will usually be waltzing around as characters from it (though occasionally I may use Danganronpa or Kingdom Hearts characters!). i do quite like the library, so you may have a higher chance of locating me there. you did find me somehow after all, if you're reading this!!</p>
<p align="center">i hope you have a delightful day or night <333</p>

<p align="center"><sub>as stated above, i may have things related to non-pony-town listed here in the future! keep an eye open or somethin flkajssdkjfs</sub>
